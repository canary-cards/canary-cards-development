        <h3 className="eyebrow-lowercase text-secondary">Why We Built Canary</h3>
        <p className="body-text">
          When the early drafts of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act included sweeping public land sellâ€‘offs, Americans from all sides flooded Congress with letters, postcards, and phone calls demanding: <strong>public land is not for sale</strong>. The public backlash was so intense that lawmakers across the political spectrum quietly stripped out the landâ€‘sale provisions from the final legislation.
        </p>
        <p className="body-text">
          That moment made something very clear to us: <strong>when people speak, decisionâ€‘makers listen</strong>. The problem is, most citizens lack the time, the confidence, or the knowâ€‘how to turn their concern into real influence.
        </p>
        <p className="body-text">
          So we built <strong>Canary</strong>, to lower the barrier so that every constituent can be heard. In just a couple of taps, your voice adds to a movement that can't be ignored. Real change can start with one clear messageâ€”your messageâ€”landing where it matters.

            <p className="body-text text-sm">
              Congressional offices consistently state that nothing has more sway on undecided votes than personalized communication from real constituentsâ€”not mass petitions, not form letters, not even most calls. In fact, 96% of Capitol Hill staff say that personalized letters specifically influence how their bosses vote, especially when the issue is undecided. The Congressional Management Foundation's research has found that messages which include personal stories, details about how an issue affects the sender, and some sign of genuine effortâ€”like writing by handâ€”get more attention and are far more likely to be passed directly to the Member.
